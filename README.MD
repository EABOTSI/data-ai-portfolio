# Public Health Data Analysis (Python EDA)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python.
It includes data profiling, correlation analysis, visualization, and actionable insights.

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (dataset source)

## Outputs
- Saved charts in `outputs/figures/`
- Summary tables in `outputs/tables/` (to be added)

## Next Steps
- Add missing-value handling and outlier checks
- Create an insights report
- Replace sample dataset with real public health / M&E dataset


### Key Insight
The variables with the strongest relationship to disease progression are related
to metabolic indicators. This suggests that targeted interventions focusing on
these factors may significantly influence outcomes.

### Model Note
A baseline linear regression model was used to validate whether the explored
features have predictive relevance. This model is illustrative and not tuned.

## Summary of Insights
- The dataset is clean with no significant missing data.
- Several metabolic indicators show strong correlation with disease progression.
- Exploratory analysis suggests meaningful statistical relationships.
- A baseline predictive model confirms relevance of key variables.
- This workflow can be applied to real public-health and M&E datasets.
